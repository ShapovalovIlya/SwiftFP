## Foundation:



## Reader:

`Reader` is a lightweight functional abstraction for dependency injection and environment-based computations in Swift. 
It lets you compose and chain logic that depends on a shared, read-only context, making your code more modular, testable, and expressive. 
Use â€Ž`Reader` to build pipelines where configuration, dependencies, or context are injected seamlesslyâ€”ideal for scalable and maintainable applications.

```swift
// Define an environment type
struct AppConfig {
    let apiEndpoint: String
    let isDebug: Bool
}

// Create a Reader that extracts the API endpoint from the environment
let apiEndpointReader = Reader<AppConfig, String> { config in
    config.apiEndpoint
}

// Create a Reader that formats a debug message based on the environment
let debugMessageReader = Reader<AppConfig, String> { config in
    config.isDebug ? "Debug mode is ON" : "Debug mode is OFF"
}

// Combine Readers to produce a summary
let summaryReader = apiEndpointReader.zip(debugMessageReader) { endpoint, debugMsg in
    "Endpoint: \(endpoint)\n\(debugMsg)"
}

// Use the Reader with a specific environment
let config = AppConfig(apiEndpoint: "https://api.example.com", isDebug: true)
let summary = summaryReader.apply(config)

print(summary)
// Output:
// Endpoint: https://api.example.com
// Debug mode is ON
```

## Either:

â€Ž`Either` is a flexible enum type for representing a value that can be one of two possible typesâ€”commonly used for error handling, 
branching logic, or modeling data with multiple valid forms. 

## Zipper:

â€Ž`Zipper` is a data structure for navigating and editing collections with a movable cursor. 
It lets you efficiently focus on, update, and traverse elements while retaining access to the context before and after the current position.
Perfect for editors, undo/redo stacks, and more.

```swift
// Create a zipper focused on "b"
let zipper = Zipper(previous: ["a"], current: "b", next: ["c", "d"])
print(zipper.current)         // "b"
print(Array(zipper.previous)) // ["a"]
print(Array(zipper.next))     // ["c", "d"]

// Move the cursor forward
var mutable = zipper
mutable.forward()
print(mutable.current)        // "c"
```

## Effect:

`Effect` is a functional abstraction for deferred computations. Inspired by the IO monad, 
Effect lets you wrap, compose, and sequence side-effecting or asynchronous operations in a predictable and testable way. 
Use Effect to organize your effects, improve code clarity, and enable powerful functional patterns in your Swift projects.

```swift
// Create an effect that returns a value
let helloEffect = Effect.pure("Hello, Effect!")

// Transform the value using map
let excitedEffect = helloEffect.map { $0 + " ðŸŽ‰" }

// Chain effects using flatMap
let greetEffect = excitedEffect.flatMap { message in
    Effect { message.uppercased() }
}

// Run the effect to get the result
print(greetEffect.run()) // Prints "HELLO, EFFECT! ðŸŽ‰"
```
